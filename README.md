# Active Home Listing Count vs. Home Builder Stock Prices Correlation
In this project, our group attempted to display the correlation between the active home listing count in the United States and the price of the top 15 home builder stocks. First, we pulled the active home listing count data from FRED and the home builder stock data from finnhub. Then, we merged the data and ran a regression and obtained p-values, which showed that both these variables were highly correlated. Lastly, we plotted the active listing count and homebuilder stock prices on a chart in order to visualize the correlation between these two variables. In conclusion, we found that active home listings are highly correlated with home builder stock prices. As active listing counts decrease, home builder stock prices increase, and vice versa.
